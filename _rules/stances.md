Stanced Up
Dogfolk are intelligent, anthropomorphic canines capable of both bipedal and quadrupedal movement, allowing them to adapt to situations with agility, cunning, and speed. Players may switch between stances as a bonus action.

#### Bipedal Stance

The standard stance for exploration, social interaction, and combat. Dogfolk may wield weapons, shields, and tools normally with spellcasting functions as usual; somatic components can be performed with paws, head gestures, or tails.

#### Quadrupedal Stance

The ideal stance for sprinting, stealth, dodging, climbing, or navigating tight spaces. While in this stance, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and your speed increases by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. You cannot wield versatile or two-handed weapons or perform somatic components while in this stance (unless otherwise specified). You have disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks and spell attacks. You may use your bite in place of a weapon attack.
