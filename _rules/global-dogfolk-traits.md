## What Da Dog Doin'?

:
Each breed listed below replaces a traditional playable race and is intrinsically linked to a specific class. These racial traits are intended to replace normal racial bonuses and are balanced to complement their associated class.

Designer's Note: In Canisgard, breed features are intentionally restrained. They are meant to flavor class identity, not replace it. If a feature seems simple, that is by design.
