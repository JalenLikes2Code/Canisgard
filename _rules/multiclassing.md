### Multiclassing
:
"The Call shapes many paths, but it does not change your blood."
:
Each Dogfolk breed is mechanically and culturally bound to one class. The racial features presented in this document are exclusive to characters of that breed.

Multiclassing does not grant access to the racial features of another breed, even if the new class matches that breed’s associated class.

A Border Collie who multiclasses into Fighter does not gain Doberman features. A Schnauzer who multiclasses into Wizard does not gain Poodle features.

Multicalssing is very much possible as it promotes creativity but breed features are fixed at character creation and cannot be exchanged, copied, or acquired through multiclassing.
