+2 to a stat of your choice, +1 to another

Eight Going On Nine

You have advantage on death saving throws.

The first time you would die permanently, you instead stabilize at 0 HP.

After this triggers, it cannot be used again until you gain a level.

Lore: Aloof, ancient, and magically inclined. Cats view themselves as the elder race and dogs as loud but earnest upstarts.
