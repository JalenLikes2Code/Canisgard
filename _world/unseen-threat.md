The Unseen Threat

Even as banners are raised and blades sharpened, older dangers stir.

Ancient magic, long kept in check by roaming adventurers, reasserts itself. The ruins of Crown's Bite awaken. Seals from The Oath of The Pack weaken. The creatures of Marfalla which were once hunted to extinction are whispered to have returned.

Adventurers now face a terrible choice:

Fight the war they understand, against enemies they recognize
or
confront the unknown, while the world burns behind them.

Many Houses demand loyalty.
The world demands action.

Both cannot be satisfied.

A World on the Brink

Canisgard does not lack heroes.
It lacks unity.
:
Every Dogfolk adventurer must decide:

Are you a blade for your House?

A shield for the helpless?

Or the last line between a fractured world and something far worse?
