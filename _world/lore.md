## Da Lore
:
Canisgard is a world shaped not by gods or prophecy, but by instinct.
Among all thinking peoples, only the Dogfolk possess the relentless drive to act, to explore, to confront danger, to intervene where others endure or withdraw. Where other races adapt, retreat, or endure, dogs step forward.
:
This has made them heroes.
:
It has also made them dangerous.

### The Nature of Adventurers

In Canisgard, adventurers are almost exclusively Dogfolk.

Not because other races lack courage, but because they lack the same compulsive call to engagement. Cats prefer mastery and patience. Badgerfolk trust stone and time. Boarfolk survive through memory and endurance. Most races see danger as something to be weathered, avoided, or waited out.
:
Dogs, however, are different.
:
They see danger and think: someone should deal with that.
:
This instinct, *the Call*, is not universal among Dogfolk, but it is common enough that nearly every band of adventurers is composed primarily, if not entirely, of dogs. To other races, this is baffling. To dogs, it is inevitable.


“If no one goes, then it will only get worse.”
— Common Dogfolk proverb
