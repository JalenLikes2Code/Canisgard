The Fall of the Crown

For centuries, Canisgard was held together by a single unifying force:
the Crown of Canis, worn by a High King chosen not by blood alone, but by the consensus of the great Houses.
:
That king is now dead.
:
Whether slain by intrigue, battle, or something darker remains unclear—but what is known is this: no successor was named, and no House can agree on who has the right to rule.

What followed was not immediate war, but something worse.
:
Border Collies fortified patrol routes.
:
Dobermans and Shepherds mobilized standing armies.
:
Saint Bernards withdrew to oathbound strongholds.
:
Huskies spread conflicting histories.
:
Schnauzers whispered of bloodlines and destiny.
:
Every House believes it is acting to preserve Canisgard.
Every House is preparing for war.
:
Without a king, House loyalty has replaced national loyalty. Trade routes are taxed or blocked entirely. Ancient alliances fracture over perceived slights.
Adventurers are increasingly pressured to swear allegiance or choose sides.
Neutrality is seen as cowardice. Taking contracts from rival Houses is seen as betrayal.
:
And yet, the world beyond the Houses does not wait.
